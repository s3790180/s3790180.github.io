							<h2>Interest in IT.</h2>
						</header>
						
  <p>I can't say I'm very knowledgeable about IT but technology in 
general has always been a fascination to me. My knowledge about what 
makes these things work has always been rather shallow and I've never 
tried diving too deep (with the few times I have I've always surfaced 
rather quickly). You can say it's always been a passing interest, but a 
passing interest that has steadily grown stronger over time. Probably 
couldn't be helped since the exponential growth of technology has made 
information technology practically a part of almost everything in our 
lives. So I decided to attend RMIT as I wanted to make a change in 
careers, in an industry where my career has always been on the periphery
 of, and studying online allowed me some measure of flexibility in how 
to approach the study material. <br>
<br>
With that being said, I'm still trying to find what I have an affinity 
for in regards to IT, but if I were to say something for the me right 
now, it'd probably be something in regards to frontend development–web 
development, app development, or even game development (always a guilty 
pleasure)–as frontend has always been the point of interaction with IT 
that I've always had. If had to say something for the future me, 
hopefully I'll at least like to know how to code with one of the myriad 
of languages out there! But I can't say I'm adverse to finding out more 
about topics such as the cloud, security or even data driven concepts.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job.</h2>
  <article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<a href="images/fulls/01.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/thumbs/01.jpg" alt=""></a></article>
</header><p>At this current point, my ideal job would be something like <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38567184?type=standard&amp;searchRequestToken=faca00c2-92a0-465c-b022-149c0c867c41" target="_blank">this</a> 
front-end development job. It has opportunities to work on both mobile 
apps and web based work. It also has some flexibility on a more personal
 level, as it allows the developer to work in an office space or 
remotely, which, like this course, could mean working from a different 
city, or even country.<br>
  <br>
The job itself requires a number of technical skills, including 
knowledge on JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML5. Unfortunately at this point, I 
don't have any of the technical skills required, but working in print 
design work, I have attained the technical skills for program such as 
the Adobe design suite that could be suitable for the design aspects 
that may be part of this role, as well an educational background in 
video and animation, which has given me skills with using Adobe's video 
package and an understanding of movement that could be beneficial for 
things like animated transitions. And there's also obviously the point 
about working as part of a team, which my previous roles as well as education all 
required, including this course.<br>
  <br>
For the listed skills for this job, I hope to take up the courses within
 this degree that cover those topics. Other skills could be covered by 
courses from other avenues–there are institutions online that 
offer various different courses on numerous different topics here.</p></section><section id="one"><header class="major"><h2>Profile.</h2>

<h3><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality" target="_blank">16personalities</a></h3>
  <p>The result of this test stated I had a personality type of <strong>Mediator (INFP-t).</strong> It says that a mediator personality "feel
 most comfortable among colleagues"–that we work better on an 
egalitarian level. This might cause some issues if someone needs to take
 charge (whether it be myself or someone else), so I'll need to be 
mindful of that.</p>

<p>
</p><h3><a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml" target="_blank">Learning Styles</a></h3>
  <p>For this test, the result came back as saying I was a <strong>visual learner</strong>, which I feel is accurate. This can both be a positive or negative, depending on how we approach the group work together.<br>
</p>


<h3><a href="http://you.visualdna.com/quiz/whoami#/quiz" target="_blank">Visual DNA - Who Am I? </a></h3>

<p>For the final test, I came out of it as <strong>'the Dude'</strong>. "(A laid-back 
drifter) You're comfortable wherever life takes you." It's fun to be 
compared to the title character of the 'The Big Lebowski', but it'll 
mean I'll need to be be prepared to be more organised and keep track of 
my work as part of a team.</p>
  <p>When forming a team, I'll need to approach others who share a 
similar mindset of the mediator, and others with a visual approach to 
work. Organisation might be an issue on my behalf, so setting up a system using tools such as <a href="http://www.trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a> to assign tasks will be very handy. <br>

<h2>Project Ideas.</h2>
</header>
<h3>Overview</h3>
Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that uses a mobile device’s 
camera to view the surrounding environment with additional information, 
usually in the form of computer generated visual information.<br>
  <br>
My project
 idea is a mobile app and digital platform with features targeted at 
tourists and locals who like to explore their surroundings. Using 
augmented reality, it combines a digital travel guide, audio tour and 
travelogue together, and enhances the users experience when traveling 
and visiting historical locations. This includes mapping of historically
 interesting locales, providing narrative in audio and overlaying 
objects on top of locations on screen, such as interactive buttons to 
access relevant information or historic photo comparisons and before and
 after images. <br>
  <br>
Introducing gaming elements on top of this allows users 
to also participate in events such as scavenger hunts or great race 
styled activities. <br>
  <br>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
Tourism is 1 of 5 super growth industries in Australia, with 9.1 million
 international visitors per year<sup><a href="#references" id="cite1">1</a></sup>. That means there are over 9 million potentially users with room for growth locally. And these are just 
national numbers. Internationally, tourism contributed over 7.6 trillion
 dollars in 2016<sup><a href="#references" id="cite2">2</a></sup> and augmented reality is expected to have 1 billion users
 by 2020<sup><a href="#references" id="cite3">3</a></sup>. According to an ISACA survey, 60% to 70% of consumers
 see clear benefits in using AR and IoT devices in their daily life<sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup>. As
 these statistics show, these markets have a lot of untapped potential to invest in. <br>
<br>
<h3>Description</h3>
The app would be a combination of the following:<br>
<br>
<strong>Digital travel book app</strong>: this would include mapping 
functions that would
 allow users to see sites of interest on their mobile device’s screen 
and plan out their trip. It could provide an itinerary for popular tours
 and adjust on the fly depending on user traffic so that popular tourist
 attractions would not be
 inundated with travellers at the same time and allow for a more 
enjoyable experience. This can also involve business establishments to 
provide services as well. <br>
<br>
<strong>Audio tour app</strong>: A popular tool for places such as museums, we can 
provide pieces of information relevant to the user and their current 
location, and not force the user to follow a set menu. <br>
<br>
<strong>Travelogue</strong>: This is the more personal side. With users creating 
accounts, they can document they journey, save photos taken (including 
augmented ones), as well as share with family and friends. <br>
<br>
<strong>Augmented reality app</strong>: The augmented reality function 
is the part that 
ties the all the above together, as well as introduce additional layers 
to it all. What it would do is, when users are at locations of interest,
 they will have the ability to interact in various ways. Icons on their 
screen to access relevant information (whether it be visually as text or
 aurally as voice over). Logical next locations could be suggested. 
Overlaying 
historical images on their screen as they use their camera, so the user 
can compare what’s currently on their screen to historical images. For 
example, seeing how a building might have looked 20, 30 or maybe 100 
years ago, or even what was there before it was a building. These could 
be provided as historical photos, artist renditions or computer 
generated imagery. As the technology gets more advanced, we can 
introduce 
animation and video, such as re-enactment of key moments in history to 
be displayed on their screen, overlayed on the images that their cameras
 are seeing, in real time. <br>

<br>
<strong>Gaming and gamification</strong>: <br>
<strong>Scavenger hunts </strong><strong>and Great Race styled activities</strong>:
 With the database of information on tourist spots and local sites, we 
can leverage all this data to create hints and tips for users to find 
interactive objects on their screen around their current location. So 
instead of using physical opjects such as QR codes to provide next 
steps, we use AR objects to replace them to tick off their digital score
 book, or provide the next step of their journeys. Both these activities
 would be linked through the network to provide up-to-date information 
between all competitors.<br>
<br>
<strong>Backend</strong>: Just as the mobile device is important for the user as the 
point of interaction, the back-end will be just as important to collate 
all the data to provide to the users. How we will create this database will be
 two-fold. First by contracting the relevant organisations (such as 
Tourism Australia) and secondly, by crowdsourcing users to provide their
 own content for access on the platform.<br>
  <br>

With this app, we can give to the user an experience that they can have 
at their own pace, or information that they themselves want more off. 
With augmented reality becoming more obtainable on mobile devices, it’s 
becoming a feature with more value as it gets more robust and developed.<br>
<br>
<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
We’ll need to utilise the augmented reality software libraries of the 
two largest mobile platforms (Android and iOS), and front-end 
development for these platforms. Also important is development for a 
web-based portal, to allow users another avenue of interaction, as well 
as allow access for organisations and users who will deal with the large
 amounts of data and information that would be accessed. <br>
  <br>
On the backend side, there will be need to develop a platform (servers) 
that allows users to upload images, sound and other media and content. 
Other technologies that would be required include access to mapping 
APIs, as the data from such platforms as google maps is already quite 
mature and data rich, which alleviates the need to build our own. <br>
  <br>
Other technologies that will be required include: server platform (such 
as AWS); mapping services (such as Google Maps API); and a security 
platform for all the data that this app will need access to. <br>
<br>
<h3>Skills Required<br>
</h3>
My lack of knowledge about detailed skills in this space makes it hard 
to be more specific, but speaking in general terms, we’ll need a team a 
developers to work on the various parts of the app. <br>
<br>
Front-end developers to work on at least 3 different platforms, Android, iOS and 
web. We may need a team dedicated to working on the AR side of things. <br>
<br>
Then we will need a team of software engineers to develop the back-end 
solutions for this app. This will probably be the larger team, as they 
would need to work on things such as real-time networking solutions as well 
cross-platform compatibility.<br>
<br>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
This project would launch in in waves, starting with one or two specific
 locations (cities), preferably with high tourist concentrations, and
 as user uptake climbs, open up the platform for more locations 
nationally. When the app gains more traction, we can open up the 
platform to an international level. Although the app is aimed at the 
tourism industry, we can open up the platforrm to other organisations, 
such as schools, where they can use this app as an educational tool, 
allowing for students to learn more about 
their surroundings and its histories.<br>
